// since we have a lot of classes and to facilitate the process of running
// I used a makefile 

N.B: FILE.mfsm is a variable entred by the user. However, it should be in the same folder or user can specify full path to file

To Compile:
- Method1
	make 
OR
-Method2 -> * is a wildcard to compile all cpp files instead of writing them all
	g++ -std=c++11 -pthread -ggdb -fno-elide-constructors -o MFSMtest *.cpp



To run:
	N.B: testfiles is specific to my case since I have a folder with this name but it can work with any provided path
	./MFSMtest testfiles/FILE.mfsm
	
To remove the run:
	make clean
	
	
	
	
Limitations:
	- it gets 7 - 10 seconds to compile
